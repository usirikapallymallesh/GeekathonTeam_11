## How it works
### A button is created.
We have created a button that allows users to bookmark a specific time instance in a video. This "Bookmark" button enables viewers to save a particular moment within a video for easy reference in the future. Once a time instance is bookmarked, users can quickly revisit that exact point in the video without having to manually seek it out. This feature is handy for educational content, tutorials, or lengthy videos, as it helps users keep track of important or interesting segments

### Not a YouTube page.

When a Chrome extension is added, it can check whether the page belongs to a YouTube page or not. If not, it can pop up as "This is not a YouTube video page."

### Youtube page but Not added bookmark.

When a Chrome extension is added, it can check if the page belongs to a YouTube page. If it is a YouTube page, the popup can show "no bookmark added"

### Added the bookmark instances.
To add a bookmark instance, simply click on the plus button. This will create a time instance with the time, a button to play it back, and a delete button to remove the bookmark instance.
